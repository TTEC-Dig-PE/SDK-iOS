iOS 8 Notes (Updated September 25, 2014)
-----------

Known issues with iOS 8.0.0 that may impact your application:
- Applications do not enter the 'active' state when started from an interactive notification
  and subsequent app sessions do not receive the application:didBecomeActive delegate call or
  UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification notification. The application state never
  transitions out of 'inactive' (Radar #18179525). This will impact the accuracy of
  reporting for applications using interactive notifications.
- Background refresh always appears to be enabled in an application even when disabled in
  settings and background push will not be delivered. Push registration will consider a
  device in this situation able to receive a background notification when it cannot. (Radar #18298439)
- Registering for UIUserNotificationTypeNone will prevent a re-registration until the device
  has been restarted and the settings are manually updated in Settings.app. There is a
  workaround for this issue in UA SDK 5.0.0. (Radar #17878212)
- The boolean properties on UIUserNotificationAction are mutated in the
  UIUserNotificationCategory isEqual: method, so the authorizationRequired and destructive
  properties on an action may receive values from actions in other categories
  in the set registered with iOS. You may see notification actions with the wrong color
  or authorization required status (Radar #18385104).

  NOTE:
  The workaround for the bug impacting registrations for UIUserNotificationTypeNone
  may impact your ability to send broadcast background pushes to ALL users if the payload
  contains a badge, alert or sound as the user facing parts of the payload will still be
  displayed by iOS even if your application has set userNotifications to NO in the SDK.
  Currently, Urban Airship will not send any notifications to users who are not opted-in,
  but we will soon be supporting the new iOS 8 feature that allows sending background push
  to these users. If you wish to make use of this feature, be sure to send only data
  (no badge/alert/sound) or wait for an updated SDK or instructions on how to disable the
  workaround. We plan to release this as soon as we have verified that iOS contains a fix
  for this issue.

-------------------------

   displayed using the UALandingPageOverlayController.

--------------------------
5.0.0 - September 17, 2014

New Features
------------
- Full support for iOS 8, including compatibility with Swift applications.
- Includes an Embedded.framework for use in applications with a minimum SDK version of 8.0.
- Includes support for interactive notifications and the new iOS 8 notification registration model.
  - Includes more than 25 built-in interactive notification sets, including button resources
    for 9 languages.
  - Additional/replacement localization strings may be added to built-in actions.
- Includes a new action for social sharing that can be called from pushes or web views.
- Includes support for defining custom events in our reporting system.
- Background push can now be used without an opt-in prompt (request remote-notification
  background type in your Info.plist).
- The inbox now stores local state for read/delete. The UI no longer needs to block while
  updates are made.
- Inbox core data operations are now performed on a background queue.

Major API Changes
-----------------
- User notifications (badge, alert, sound) now default to OFF. This change is designed to
  make it easier to prompt for permission in the right spot. If you were relying on the
  old default (push enabled at start), you will need to update your registration logic.
- Supports iOS 6+. (Support for iOS 5 has been removed).
- UA location now handles iOS8-style authorization. Once location reporting is started and
  an authorization prompt is presented, changes to the authorization level are not possible
  without updating the app in the App Store. By default, "always" authorization will be requested.
  To request "when in use" set the property 'requestAlwaysAuthorization' to NO on UALocationService.
- Replaced existing tag modifiers on UAPush with more concisely named methods: addTag, addTags,
  removeTag, and removeTags.
- FOR DETAILED INFO: http://docs.urbanairship.com/topic_guides/ios_migration.html

Sample UI Changes
-----------------
- Removed UAInboxUI and UAPushUI protocols. Sample code now displays views directly.
- Refactored the localization in both sample projects.
- Moved sample resources to a new common folder (including those used in the interactive
  notifications).
- Sample projects now include targets that use the embedded framework (static library
  still used in the original targets).

General Modernization
---------------------
- Modernized init and factory methods. All now return `instancetype` rather than `id` or
  concrete classes.
- NS_ENUM and NS_OPTIONS are now used throughout.
- Removed previously deprecated methods and classes.
- Removed use of methods deprecated in iOS 6 (now that iOS 5 support has been dropped).

Documentation Updates
---------------------
- The SDK distribution now includes the API reference documentation in the `reference-docs` folder.
- The generated (header) documentation (in reference-docs) now has complete coverage of our public interface,
  including enums and block types.

--------------------------
4.0.4 - September 10, 2014
--------------------------
 - Fixed iOS 8 push prompt on first-run and immediate opt-out.
 - Fixed quiet time setting not persisting between application restarts.
 - Added work around for iOS 8 registration bug where disabling push registering prevents registering for notification types
   without a device restart. Instead of registering for 0 notification types, the device will just be marked as opted-out. This only 
   affects newer iOS 8 devices. For more information, see the documentation for allowUnregisteringUserNotificationTypes on UAPush. 
 - UA location is now compatible with iOS 8 authorization modes. If building against Xcode 6, make sure to add the new authorization
   keys (NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription and NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription) to the application's info.plist. You must also manually
   request the correct authorization before starting location on Urban Airship by calling either requestWhenInUseAuthorization or requestAlwaysAuthorization on CLLocationManager.

-----------------------

-----------------------
 - Fix undefined symbols build issue when building against the iOS 5 version of the static library.
