/**
 * !v0.1 is ARC only!
 * Yet another calendar component for iOS. Compatible with iOS 4.0 (iPhone & iPad) and higher.
 * 
 * PMCalendarController appears as a popover (if you used UIPopoverController before,
 * you'll find PMCalendar management very similar), supports orientation changes 
 * and does not require any third party frameworks.
 *
 * PMCalendar supports selection of multiple dates within one or several months. To select date
 * on a next or previous month, just press on a desired start date and move finger to the edge 
 * of the calendar. In 0.5 of a second the calendar will start to iterate through months automatically.
